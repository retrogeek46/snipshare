# SnipShare
SnipShare is a small tool to quickly share snippets from a desktop environment to mobile so that your handheld device can act as a second monitor for static image content.

This project is for the desktop app + server and is built using ElectronJS for desktop application, ExpressJS/NodeJS for server and Socket.io for sending realtime data.

## Installation
You can download the latest portable win32-64 version of the app from the [Releases](https://github.com/retrogeek46/snipshare/releases) page

## How to Use
- Upon launching the application you will be provided with a url. You can open it using you phone in any recent browser while being connected to the same network as your desktop.
